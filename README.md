tortoise-and-hare
=================

* Creates tortoise(turtle) and hare(rabbit) objects, then executes a race
  (object).

* The winner is output by default. It also allows the user to analyze the race performance and tune parameters.

* Barebones objects were taken from Brook's class demo. Much html interaction
and other code written with syntax help from the JavaScript & JQuery textbook
and from stack overflow and some other Googling for troubleshooting.
